Here we identify such WM structures whose mean fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate measure of WM integrity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), changes significantly between the acute and chronic stages of mTBI after controlling for age, sex, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB) count. We analyzed MRIs acquired acutely and chronically (within ∼7 days and ∼6 months post‐injury, respectively) from 109 subjects aged 18‐77 (46 females, age μ ± σ = 40 ± 17 years). Using principal component analysis, we identified ten primary WM structures of interest and partialled out covariate effects while also computing the standardized residuals (SRs) associated with the multivariate regression of risk factors (predictors) against the pairs of mean FAs for the left and right hemisphere portions of each WM structure (responses). For each such structure, the SRs obtained for each time point were used in paired‐sample Hotelling's ,‐tests of the null hypothesis of no FA mean change across time. The body and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC), the right middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF), left superficial frontal (Sup‐F) tracts, and the left corticospinal tract (CST) were found to exhibit significant mean FA decreases (, < 0.05). Our findings identify these structures as most vulnerable to deterioration after mTBI above and beyond the effects of age, sex, and CMBs. Because WM degradation within these tracts are related to decreased motor coordination, speech deficits, and impaired memory, our findings identify cognitive functions mediated by the CC, MdLF, Sup‐F and CST as potential targets for future rehabilitation protocols and risk assessment strategies. Future research should explore how WM integrity changes in these structures modulate post‐traumatic cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.,, Jiwon Ryu,, Michael Horsmon,, Athanasios Alexandris,, Samantha Wozniak,, Karin Rafaels,, Diego Iacono,, Daniel Perl,, Vassilis Koliatsos,, Jihyun Kim,, Bryan Pfister,, Haesun Kim,, Youngrim Lee,, Mohamed Lehar,, Zahra Alam,, Jiwon Ryu,, Derek Weslbie,, Donald Zack,, Vassilis Koliatsos,, Leah Vaughan,, Haiyan Xu,, Zhihui Yang,, Erin Trifilio,, John Williamson,, Richard Rubenstein,, Claudia Robertson,, Amy Wagner,, Kevin Wang,, Susan Margulies,, Niina Lapinlampi,, Eppu Manninen,, Shalini Das Gupta,, Olli Jääskeläinen,, Sanna‐Kaisa Herukka,, Noora Puhakka,, Asla Pitkänen,Ayah Istanbouli,, ,, Lindsey Morrow,, Haiyan Xu,, Milin Kurup,, Sonia Jain,, Xiaoying Sun,, Robert Logan Patterson,, Firas Kobeissy,, Geoff Manley,, Zhihui Yang,, Kevin Wang,, Rowan Brothers,, Alyssa Pybus,, Rachel Grosswald,, Edgar Ortiz,, Levi Wood,, Erin Buckley,, Leah Vaughan,, David Barton,, Zhihui Yang,, Richard Rubenstein,, Claudia Robertson,, Kevin Wang,, Amy Wagner,, John Williamson,, Leah Vaughan,, Zhihui Yang,, Haiyan Xu,, John Williamson,, Claudia Robertson,, Richard Rubenstein,, Kevin Wang,, Amy Wagner,, John Yue,, Andrea Schneider,, Geoff Manley,, Ramon Diaz‐Arrastia,, And the TRACK‐TBI Investigators,Drashti Patel,, ,, Haiyan Xu,, Leah Vaughan,, John Williamson,, Amy Wagner,, Richard Rubenstein,, Claudia Robinson,, Kevin Wang,, Zhihui Yang,Aaron Shoemaker,, Kira Jeffris,, Gina Gabrielli,, Alyssa Togliatti,, Rajeswari Pichika,, Eric Martin,, Evangelos Kiskinis,, Colin Franz,, ,, Shervin Jannesar,, Ernesto Salegio,, Yvette Nout‐Lomas,, Jacqueline Bresnahan,, Michael Beattie,, Carolyn Sparrey,, Cesar Jimenez,, Ernesto Salegio,, Yvette Nout‐Lomas,, Jacqueline Bresnahan,, Michael Beattie,, Carolyn Sparrey,, Michael Grovola,, Dayo Adewole,, Kevin Browne,, Mary Putt,, John O'Donnell,, Kacy Cullen,, Eric Abrahamson,, Matthew Harper,, Milos Ikonomovic,, Shengnan Sun,, Zhaoyu Wang,, Yongchao Ge,, Jeffrey Nemes,, Christina LaValle,, Angela Boutte,, Walter Carr,, Gary Kamimori,, Rania Abutarboush,, Eileen Reed,, Ruixuan Zhang,, Jacob Patterson,, Cameron Watson,, Ming Gu,, Theepica Jeyarajah,, Stephen Ahlers,, Shanyan Chen,, Ashley Balderrama,, Runting Li,, Landry M.

Currier Thomas,Cerebrovascular aging (CVA) is a risk factor for cognitive decline, dementia, stroke, cerebral aneurysms, and adverse outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI). CVA is associated with extracellular matrix impairment, vascular wall weakening and stiffening, blood‐brain‐barrier (BBB) permeability, and cytokine production. However, the mechanisms contributing to CVA‐associated increases in vulnerability to TBI for the geriatric population are poorly understood. A mutation in the fibrillin‐1 (,) gene leads to elevated systemic transforming‐growth‐factor‐β (TGF‐β) and matrix‐metalloproteinases (MMPs) ‐2/‐9 implicated in CVA. This study utilized heterozygotes of a well‐characterized transgenic mouse model (,) to test the hypothesis that increased TGF‐β/MMP activity would accelerate aging‐associated cerebrovascular rigidity, BBB permeability, and neurological alterations, leaving the brain more vulnerable to diffuse TBI. In 6, 9, and 12M‐old , and C57BL/6 wildtype (WT) male and female mice, posterior cerebral artery (PCA) rupture point (N = 3‐5/group), BBB permeability (N = 2‐3/group), injury viability (N = 2‐3/group), and neurobehavioral severity scale (NSS) outcomes (N = 10‐11/group) were assessed. Our data shows that 6M‐old , mice have compromised PCA wall strength (p < 0.05), increased BBB permeability (p < 0.05), and elevated NSS scores (p < 0.05) in comparison to 6M‐old WT and similar to 12M‐old WT mice. To investigate vulnerability to mild‐TBI (mTBI), varying pulse pressures (1.11‐1.32atm) were applied to the brains of 6M‐old WT (1.25‐1.32atm) and , (1.17‐1.21atm ) mice using midline fluid percussion injury, where , mice required lower pressure to induce mTBI righting reflex times (4‐6minutes). These data support that CVA via increased TGF‐β/MMP plays a critical role in the vulnerability of the aged brain to mTBI. This novel approach allows for the mechanistic study of TGF‐β/MMP pathways that could serve as a therapeutic target for prevention or managment of symptoms in geriatric TBI patients.,, Monica Langley,, Whitney Simon,, Hyesook Yoon,, Isobel Scarisbrick,, Andrew Pearson,, Fiona Crawford,, Joseph Ojo,, Anne Marchildon,, John Cave,, Edmund Hollis,, Chandra Bogguri,, Jose Cadena,, Alexander Ladd,, Aimy Sebastian,, Heather Enright,, Nicholas Fishcher,, Anabelle Paulino,, Sally Temple,, Larry Benowitz,, Athanasios Alexandris,, Labchan Rajbhandari,, Arun Venkatesan,, Vassilis Koliatsos,Grace Conley,, Nicholas Morriss,, Masen Boucher,, Sara Ospina‐Mora,, Yue Li,, ,, William Meehan,, Rebekah Mannix,, Michael Morrison,, Merry Wick,, Manley Geoff,, Roth Mark,, Andrew Ding,, Akhila Penumarthy,, Luis Martinez Ramirez,, Jill Hunter,, Christopher Nguyen,, Beth Costine‐Bartell,, Natasha Wilkins,, Brian Schmit,, Shekar Krupad,, Matthew Budde,, Heather Minchew,, Sadie Ferren,, Sarah Christian,, Paul Keselman,, Janna Harris,Vivian Guedes,, Sara Mithani,, Ethan Smith,, Dilorom Sass,, Cyndi Williams,, Jessica Gill,, ,, Leah Vaughan,, Marina Levochkina,, Erica Fan,, Yvette Conley,, Richard Rubenstein,, Kevin Wang,, Amy Wagner,, Eric Gier,, David Gaul,, Facundo Fernandez,, Michelle LaPlaca,, Meenakshi Banerjee,, Shravani Prakhya,, Smita Joshi,, Hemendra Vekaria,, Kathryn Saatman,, Martha Sim,, Jeremy Wood,, Sidney Whiteheart,, Patrick Sullivan,, Christina LaValle, Jonathan Salib, Anthony Misistia, Peter Chin, Ilsse Salinas, Brian Johnson, John King, Bradley Garfield, Gary Kamimori,, Susan Schwerin,, Sharon Juliano,, Dzenis Mahmutovic,, Michael Benko,, Biswajit Maharathi,, Stefanie Robel,, Fernanda Guilhaume Correa,, Pamela VandeVord,, Susan Murphy,, Justin Weatherbee,, Pamela VandeVord,, Vladislav Bugay,, Aiola Stoja,, Sang Chun,, Deborah Holstein,, James Lechleiter,, Martin Paukert,, Robert Brenner,, Mark Shapiro,, Anne VanCott,, Sidney Hinds,, Alan Towne,, David Titus,, Akhila Sangadi,, Timothy Johnstone,, Derk Hogenkamp,, Kelvin Gee,, Coleen Atkins,, Dinesh Sangadi,, Akhila Sangadi,, Orlando Martinez,, Chantal Sanchez,, Fabiola Placeres‐Uray,, David Titus,, Timothy Johnstone,, Derk Hogenkamp,, Kelvin Gee,, Ewout Steyerberg,, Andrew Maas,, David Menon,, Ari Ercole,, Joshua Thackray,, Matthew Ricci,, Victoria Abraira,, Jonathan Elmer,, Lori Shutter,, Jed Hartings,, Pulkit Grover,, Lili‐Naz Hazrati,, Eileen Storey,, Lei Wang,, Matthew Grady,, Catherine McDonald,, Susan Margulies,, Kristy Arbogast,, Hasan Ayaz,, Olivia Podolak,, Kenneth Ciuffreda,, Nabin Joshi,, Catherine McDonald,, Susan Margulies,, Matthew Grady,, Kristy Arbogast,, Andrew Knutsen,, Alexandru Korotcov,, Asamoah Bosomtwi,, Jiong Liu,, Amanda H.

We defined the heterogeneity of microglia and macrophage phenotypes during TBI in wild type (WT) mice and , mice, which lack macrophage influx following TBI and are resistant to brain damage. We used unbiased single‐cell RNA sequencing methods to uncover 25 microglia, monocyte/macrophage, and dendritic cell subsets in acute TBI and normal brains. We discovered alterations in cell numbers and/or transcriptional profiles of six microglia subsets in , TBI mice compared to WT TBI mice indicating that infiltrating monocytes/macrophages influence microglia activation to promote a type I IFN response. Preclinical pharmacological blockade of hCCR2 after injury reduced IFN‐responsive gene, ,, expression, and improved outcomes. These data extend our understanding of myeloid cell diversity, crosstalk in brain trauma, and identify new therapeutic targets in myeloid cell subsets.,, Nadine Kerr,, Juan Pablo de Rivero Vaccari,, Helen Bramlett,, Robert Keane,, W.

Gupta,, Kelly Maers,, Eric Li,, Franca Cambi,, Nilkantha Sen,, Dandan Sun,Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients often develop long‐lasting white matter injury, which contributes to motor‐sensory and cognitive function deficits. Upon brain injury, microglia can be rapidly activated toward pro‐inflammatory responses, leading to white matter demyelination, or with adaptive functions to release restorative cytokines that initiate remyelination. It remains incompletely understood how microglial polarizations impact white matter tissue damage/repair after TBI. Microglial Na,/H, exchanger (NHE1) mediates H, efflux in the microglial pH, homeostasis and is required for microglial activation. In this study, we investigated roles of microglial NHE1 in modulating microglial polarizations after TBI. Selective deletion of microglial , in , mice (, cKO mice) was induced by tamoxifen (Tam) at P30‐34, and TBI was induced by controlled cortical impact at P65‐70. Compared to the wild‐type (WT) control mice, the cKO mice exhibited accelerated motor‐sensory functional recovery during 1‐14 days post‐TBI. Flow cytometry showed that the cKO microglia increased the restorative Ym1 and CD206 expressions at 3 days post‐TBI. Concurrently, oligodendrogenesis and white matter remyelination were increased in these cKO brains, with increased counts of both mature oligodendrocytes and their progenitor cells, as well as corpus callosum (CC) thickness. In addition, post‐TBI administration of a potent NHE1 protein inhibitor HOE642 reduced lesion size and improved white matter integrity, detected by increased fractional anisotropy values in MRI diffused tensor imaging. These HOE642‐treated mice similarly displayed improved post‐TBI motor‐sensory and cognitive function recovery. These findings collectively suggest that blocking NHE1 protein modulates restorative microglial activation, which enhances oligodendrogenesis and white matter repair for functional recovery after TBI.,, Alan Siefert,, John F.
